Paradox V2 Roadmap – Image & Video Integration
Phase 0: Research & Design [x]

Phase 1: Image Integration [x]
[x] Implement image encoder (autoencoder-based)
[x] Implement image decoder for on-demand reconstruction
[x] Test storage and retrieval of 10k–100k images

Phase 2: Video Integration [x]
[x] Implement video encoder (frame-by-frame)
[x] Implement video decoder to reconstruct sequences
[x] Support storing sequences of latent vectors efficiently

Phase 3: Latent Superposition & Blending [x]
[x] Implement blending of latent vectors (image/image, video/frame)
[x] Enable emergent patterns from combined latent states (Verified Red+Blue=Purple)

Phase 4: Engine Upgrades [x]
[x] Extend ProximityEngine to handle images and video sequences
[x] Implement disk-backed storage for large media datasets (memmap supported)
[x] Integrate GPU acceleration for encoding/decoding (Hybrid Mixer)
[x] Optimize query/search in latent space (Parallel Simulation)

Phase 5: Simulation & Temporal Dynamics [x]
[x] Support dynamics functions for videos/images (motion, color evolution)
[x] Enable interactive simulation of latent-space evolution (via UI)
[x] Visualize temporal changes and emergent behaviors (via UI & GIF)

Phase 6: The Interface (V0.5.0)

[x] Integrate Antigravity IDE for live visualization (Streamlit Dashboard)

[x] Media Studio (Upload/Search) implementation

[x] Latent Laboratory (Blending UI)

Provide examples and tutorials for multimedia workflows

Phase 7: Production & Deployment

Package V2 for PyPI and Docker

Ensure CPU-only mode works for small datasets

Document API and provide migration guide from V1

Phase 8: Future Extensions

Integrate multimodal support (text + image + video)

Explore real-time streaming video reconstruction

Enable collaborative cloud simulations with distributed latent memory

Research generative and procedural AI outputs using latent media
